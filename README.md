# RefactorHtml
This was a social media marketing page with outdated html code. I started with existing code and worked to make it more semantic.

## What I learned

I learned how to better organize the html by specifying section, article, aside, header, or footer rather than just div. I learned to give classes to articles and sections so I can target them all on the css sheet and reduce code. I also made comments through my code to explain my changes and additions. I included ali tags for each image in the case that the image doesnt load right away or the user needs it for accessibilty.
